        <h2>About Tobacco Addict Studios™</h2>
        <p>
          Tobacco Addict Studios™ (TOBADD™) is a small, independent game studio located in Reno, NV—the heart of the United States—with one mission: Make Games Fun Again (MGFA).
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to bring back what made the classics so great, incorporating fun features with the power of modern tech. With this goal in mind, our games come out being unique, fun, and user-friendly. You’ll get that sense of nostalgia without the clunky design or controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, our library contains a series of short games and minigames you can jump into at any time with anyone. They’re not meant to be taken seriously—and can take any amount of time out of your day to chill.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT! Eventually... Our library will be expanded vastly to include new types of content and options for the player including:
        </p>

        <ul style={{ listStylePosition: "outside", paddingLeft: "1.2rem", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
          <li>Short films/series</li>
          <li>Full-length films/series</li>
          <li>Full-length games</li>
          <li>
            Community content with featured posts (and an upgraded posts/social system) and user-submitted short/minigames
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
          The site will continue to be expanded into a hub for Tobacco Addict Studios™ with all types of media and community connection.
